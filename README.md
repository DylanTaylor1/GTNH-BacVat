# Introduction

The bacterial vat is a GregTech multiblock that outputs varying levels of fluid depending on the capacity of the output hatch. It follows a sigmoidal population curve with maximum efficiency (1:1 input fluid to output fluid) when the output hatch is exactly half full. While it is possible to keep the output hatch at roughly half with just a fluid detector cover and a conduit/pump, it is difficult to guarantee that the output hatch will be exactly half full every single time. These lua scripts, however, are designed to always pull the perfect amount of fluid from the output hatch, maximizing efficiency.
